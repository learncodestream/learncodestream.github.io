For Code Stream this means grouping Administrator, Member or Viewer access to Pipelines, Executions, User Operations, Endpoints, Variables, and Triggers. A user can be a member of many different projects, and hold different roles in each project.
Projects Project Member Permissions Administrator - Manage Pipelines, Manage Restricted Pipelines, Execute Pipelines, Execute Restricted Pipelines, Manage Executions, Read objects Member - Manage Pipelines, Execute Pipelines, Read objects Viewer - Read objects Restricted Endpoints/Variables Endpoints and Variables can be marked as restricted, which means that only users with Administrator rights (either Code Stream Administrator, or Project Administrator) can manage them.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/variables/</guid><description>Variables are a great way to keep text, secrets etc. that you have to reuse, in your Pipelines, in one central place, to easily manage. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good practice, if you need to export your pipelines, to make sure, that sensetive information is not exported as well.
