Code Stream; A delivery pipeline modeling tool for managing app/infra delivery onto the cloud.\nA continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) release pipeline tool that allows developers to model and automate the entire release process.

Helping teams to deliver software and code changes faster and more reliably with higher quality while reducing manual and operational risk traditionally struggle with.\nCI – Code to Artifact CD – Release, Deploy, Monitor\nWhat are Code Stream’s capabilities around application deployment, testing, and troubleshooting?\nDevelopers are able to request the latest certified application build from the catalog, deploy and test their changes against a sandbox or existing environment, and track the progress of their code across environments after committing their change.\nTo accelerate time-to-value, Code Stream also provides pre-built pipeline plugins to tools such as WaveFront and Log Insight for troubleshooting, Harbor and Nexus for repositories, Kubernetes for container orchestration, Ansible for configuration management, and Slack for notifications and collaboration.\nAnd finally, Code Stream provides a customizable dashboard so that DevOps teams can measure their release KPIs and identify bottlenecks or problem areas in the release process.\nIf you want to find out more about vRealize Automation please visit our website, or to learn more about our features, vRealize Automation Code Stream and explore vRealize Automation Cloud get started with a free 45-day trial!\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/bamboo/","title":"Bamboo","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":18,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/bamboo/","title":"Bamboo","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":19,"href":"/categories/","title":"Categories","parent":"","content":""},{"id":20,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/ci/","title":"CI","parent":"Tasks","content":"A CI task is one of the most used Task types\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/condition/","title":"Condition","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":22,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/custom/","title":"Custom","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":23,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/docker/","title":"Docker","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":24,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/dockeregistry/","title":"Docker Registry","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":25,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/email/","title":"Email","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":26,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/gerrit/","title":"Gerrit","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":27,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/git/","title":"Git","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":28,"href":"/Getting-Started/helloworld/","title":"Hello World","parent":"Getting Started","content":"My first pipeline\n"},{"id":29,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/jenkins/","title":"Jenkins","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":30,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/jira/","title":"Jira","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":31,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/kubernetes/","title":"Kubernetes","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":32,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/kubernetes/","title":"Kubernetes","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":33,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/poll/","title":"Poll","parent":"Tasks","content":"Poll\n"},{"id":34,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/powershell/","title":"PowerShell","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":35,"href":"/Getting-Started/publishing/","title":"Publishing Pipelines","parent":"Getting Started","content":"Code Stream Pipelines can be published to Service Broker with a Custom Form, allowing you to create a much more interactive user experiece.\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/rest/","title":"REST","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":37,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/ssh/","title":"SSH","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":38,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"","content":""},{"id":39,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/tfs/","title":"TFS","parent":"Endpoints","content":""},{"id":40,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/tfs/","title":"TFS","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":41,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/useroperation/","title":"User Operation","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":42,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/cloudtemplate/","title":"VMware Cloud Template","parent":"Tasks","content":"Hmmm\n"},{"id":43,"href":"/Pipelines/Tasks/vro/","title":"vRealize Orchestrator","parent":"Tasks","content":""},{"id":44,"href":"/Configure/Endpoints/vro/","title":"vRealize Orchestrator (vRO)","parent":"Endpoints","content":""}]
