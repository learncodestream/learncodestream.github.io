Pipeline Stages Properties can be accessed from each stage and task using ${Stage.Task.Property} - for example, in the &amp;ldquo;Build&amp;rdquo; Stage the &amp;ldquo;Trigger Image Enumeration&amp;rdquo; task is a REST API call with a JSON response. The response property &amp;ldquo;id&amp;rdquo; is referenced using ${Build.</description></item><item><title>GitOps in Code Stream</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Getting-Started/GitOps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Getting-Started/GitOps/</guid><description>!</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/Projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/Projects/</guid><description>A Project in vRealize Automation is used to scope user access to resources within the platform. For Code Stream this means grouping Administrator, Member or Viewer access to Pipelines, Executions, User Operations, Endpoints, Variables, and Triggers. A user can be a member of many different projects, and hold different roles in each project.
Projects Project Member Permissions Administrator - Manage Pipelines, Manage Restricted Pipelines, Execute Pipelines, Execute Restricted Pipelines, Manage Executions, Read objects Member - Manage Pipelines, Execute Pipelines, Read objects Viewer - Read objects Restricted Endpoints/Variables Endpoints and Variables can be marked as restricted, which means that only users with Administrator rights (either Code Stream Administrator, or Project Administrator) can manage them.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/variables/</guid><description>Variables are a great way to keep reusable text values or secrets for use in Pipelines in one central place. Variables are scoped to a Project and can be used to provide secure access to credentials or configuration information. Using Variables ensures that if you need to export your pipelines that sensitive information is not exported, and allows you to control access to that sensitive information.
Variables Type (see ) REGULAR - Value is plain text and accessible to any Project role SECRET - Value is hidden but can be used in Pipelines by Project members and administrators RESTRICTED - Value is hidden and can only be accessed in Pipelines by administrators Project - Variables need to be attached to a project.</description></item><item><title>Gerrit</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Triggers/Gerrit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Triggers/Gerrit/</guid><description>Gerrit Trigger</description></item><item><title>Git</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Triggers/Git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Triggers/Git/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Docker</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Triggers/Docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Triggers/Docker/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bamboo</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/Endpoints/bamboo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Configure/Endpoints/bamboo/</guid><description> Bamboo The Atlassian Bamboo endpoint is easy to configure.

It then executes the CI task script in the context of the running container. It is an incredibly powerful and flexible task type, because the image can have almost any tool or program in it.
The CI task runs using parameters configured in the Pipeline Workspace configuration, including the Container Image, Docker Registry, Docker Host, directory, cache, environment variables and CPU/Memory limits.</description></item><item><title>Condition</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Condition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Condition/</guid><description>The Condition Task is very similar to the Precondition setting available for all Tasks, without having an additional task attached to it. It can be used to evaluate the success of previous Stages before moving on with the Pipeline, or to trigger the failure of a pipeline based on a set of conditions. Simple operators can be used to compare Pipeline task output, Variables, Inputs, or any other property that is accessible in the Pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Custom</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Custom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Custom/</guid><description>The Custom Task allows you to use Custom Integrations in Pipeline Stages - for more details please see the Custom Integrations page.

You can use a Git Endpoint for the YAML manifest definitions. The combination of Git Endpoints, use of a Git Triggers and the Kubernetes task allows you to build complex Kubernetes application deployment strategies.
Common across all the Kubernetes actions is are:
Kubernetes Cluster - the Kubernetes endpoint that the task will execute against Timeout - the task timeout while waiting for a response from Kubernetes, this can be useful if, for example, your deployment task needs to download several large container images that may exceed the default timeout, or your deployment has readiness checks that take time to return OK.</description></item><item><title>Pipeline</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Pipeline/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Pipeline/</guid><description>The Pipeline task allows you to nest existing Pipelines within a parent pipeline, which is really useful for chaining together smaller units of work within a larger parent process.

The Task configured below will execute a Pipeline called &amp;ldquo;vra-POST&amp;rdquo;, the three Input parameters (vraAccessToken, vraRequestPayload, vraRequestUri) for the Pipeline have been automatically added to the task and the one output paramter vraResponseJSON has been added to the output parameters.</description></item><item><title>Poll</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Poll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/Pipelines/Tasks/Poll/</guid><description>The Poll task is most commonly used in combination with the REST task to Poll for a job completion status, however, it can be used to Poll any HTTP server and wait for a success or failure criteria to be evaluated - or a timeout to expire.
