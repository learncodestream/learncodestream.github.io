For Code Stream this means grouping Administrator, Member or Viewer access to Pipelines , Executions , User Operations , Endpoints , Variables , and Triggers . A user can be a member of many different projects, and hold different roles in each project.
Projects Project Member Permissions Administrator - Manage Pipelines, Manage Restricted Pipelines, Execute Pipelines, Execute Restricted Pipelines, Manage Executions, Read objects Member - Manage Pipelines, Execute Pipelines, Read objects Viewer - Read objects Restricted Endpoints/Variables Endpoints and Variables can be marked as restricted, which means that only users with Administrator rights (either Code Stream Administrator, or Project Administrator) can manage them.</description></item><item><title>Variables</title><link>https://learncodestream.github.io/configure/variables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://learncodestream.github.io/configure/variables/</guid><description>Variables are a great way to keep reusable text values or secrets for use in Pipelines in one central place. Variables are scoped to a Project and can be used to provide secure access to credentials or configuration information. Using Variables ensures that if you need to export your pipelines that sensitive information is not exported, and allows you to control access to that sensitive information.
Variables Type (see ) REGULAR - Value is plain text and accessible to any Project role SECRET - Value is hidden but can be used in Pipelines by Project members and administrators RESTRICTED - Value is hidden and can only be accessed in Pipelines by administrators Project - Variables need to be attached to a project.</description></item></channel></rss>
